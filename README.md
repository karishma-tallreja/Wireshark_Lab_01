# Wireshark_Lab_01 - Host-Only HTTP Traffic Capture

## Objective
To analyze HTTP traffic between a Windows host and a DSL virtual server using Wireshark on a Host-Only network (VMnet1).

### Tools and Setup
- Wireshark
- VMware Workstation
- DSL Linux Server
- Host-Only Network (VMnet1)
- PuTTY

## ðŸ§¾ Steps Performed
1. Set up a host-only network and verify connectivity using `ping`.
2. Captured packets using Wireshark on the VMnet1 adapter.
3. Accessed a web page hosted on the DSL server.
4. Filtered HTTP traffic and analyzed HTTP GET requests.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Observations
- HTTP GET request successfully captured.
- TCP 3-way handshake observed.
- Protocols like ICMPv6, DNS, and TCP were also present.
- Confirmed browser caching behavior (e.g., HTTP 304 Not Modified).

### What I Learned / Skills
- Set up VMware Host-Only network (VMnet1)
- Verified connectivity using ping on Windows and Linux VMs
- Captured and filtered packets with Wireshark (focused on HTTP traffic)
- Analyzed HTTP GET requests and response codes (e.g., 304 Not Modified)
- Used Linux commands (ifconfig, ping) in DSL VM
- Interpreted Ethernet, IP, TCP, and HTTP packet details
- Cleared browser cache and restarted captures for accurate results
- Connected to Linux VM via PuTTY SSH terminal
